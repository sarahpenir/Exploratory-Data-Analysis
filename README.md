# Exploratory Data Analysis: Course Project 2

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximately every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it says about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008.
